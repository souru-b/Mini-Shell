# Mini-Shell
Designed and implemented a lightweight command-line shell in C that mimics basic  functionalities of a Linux shell. The mini shell supports execution of built-in and external commands,  handles input/output redirection, and  parses user input, creates child processes using fork(), and  executes commands using exec() family system calls.
